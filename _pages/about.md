# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me
I received my Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Dan Feng](https://hustdfeng.github.io/)) and M.S degree (advised by [Prof. ZhiPeng Tan](https://msata-lab.github.io/)) in Computer Architecture from the [Data Storage and Application Lab](https://storage.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2024 and 2016, respectively. 
I was a visiting Ph.D. student (advised by [Prof. Jizhong Han](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hjz)) at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) from 2017-2019. 
I received the B.S. degree in Software Engineering from the School of Computer, Southwest Minzu University (SMU) in 2012.  

My research interests encompass the following areas: **system reliability and consistency assurance, predictive maintenance of storage drives, AI for systems, and distributed systems**. 
I have published 10+ refereed papers in major conferences and journals in the field of computer systems and architecture, including FGCS, JCST, DATE, ICCD, ICPP, and MSST, etc. 

I have participated in multiple national-level projects, including the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups and the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the National Defense Pre-Research Foundation of China, the Chinese Defence Advance Research Program of Science and Technology, China, and the major project of the National Social Science Fund of China. 
And I contributed to the drafting of GB/T 37939-2019 "Information Security Technology - Security Techniques Requirements for Network Storage".

As a core technical member, I have also participated in 10+ research projects collaborating with important government agencies and enterprises such as Office of the Central Cyberspace Administration Affairs Commission, Huawei, Honor, Hikvision, and China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. 

Meanwhile, I have participated in the application of 10+ Chinese invention patents, all of which have been granted. 
As the key technical personnel, the successful commercialization of two patents outcomes related to disk failure prediction was achieved, generating economic benefits exceeding one million yuan. 

My research about failure prediction for storage drives, as one of the key innovations in the project "Key Technologies and Applications for Efficient and Reliable Massive Data Storage Systems", was awarded the Second Grade of the National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2023.
